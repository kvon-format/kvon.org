			Objects are collections of keys-value pairs. When the key's value is
			a primitive (number, string, boolean), or an array of primitives, the
			key-value pair can be written in one line.
			<br>
			If the value is an object then each of the following keys must be
			written in a new line and indented to the right compared to their
			root. If the value is omitted it will be assumed to be null.

			Consider the following KVON and equivalent JSON:

	<h2 class="title-sub">Strings</h2>
	<div class="p-2">
		<p class="prose-xl w-full xl:w-9/12">
			There are two types of string syntaxes: single and multi line.
			Single line strings must be delimited with either single quotes or
			double quotes. If the string itself contains quotes, it can be
			delimited with multiple quotes. For example: if a string contains the
			character `'`, it can be delimited with `"` or `'''` in order
			for the `'` not to count as a delimiter.
			<br>
			Multi line strings are initiated with the `|` character and the
			lines must come below it, and indented forward.

	<div class="p-2">
		<p class="prose-xl w-full xl:w-9/12">
			There are two types of array syntaxes: single and multi line arrays.
			Single line arrays can contain primitives, and sub single line arrays.
			Multi line arrays can contain any value, every line can contain any
			number of values. However, Multi line strings, multi line arrays,
			and objects must be placed on their lines.
			Objects are initiated with `:--` if they come after a key, and with
			a `--` if they come as one of a different multi line array's values.
